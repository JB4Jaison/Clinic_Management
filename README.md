# Clinic_Management
A Clinic Management System using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio And SQL 
The project is developed with a motive to computerize the various processes involved in a clinic. 
This has been built for two end users: The Doctor and The Receptionist. The receptionist is responsible for creating and managing the patient file system and also facilitates the booking of appointments with the doctor. The patient will have their own records with all the necessary details such as date of admission, bills, prescriptions, allergies and various other details stored. Patients are assigned any of the departments depending on the disease. Doctors, of the respective department, will be booked depending on availability and the assigned doctor can view the patient details and has the provision to diagnose the disease and add a prescription for the patient. The receptionist can then generate bill and feed into the database. The system also maintains patient’s history so that doctor or receptionist can view them anytime. The system can thus reduce complexity in maintaining patient’s records.
The project is developed on C#.net platform and is supported by a SQL database to store user specific details
